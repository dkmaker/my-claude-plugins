# List Transcripts

Use the context script to show all available transcripts:

!`get-transcript-context.sh`

The script shows comprehensive information including:
- Current session details
- Project configuration
- Available transcripts (last 10 shown)
- Generated HTML reports
- .gitignore status

Review the output and provide a brief summary to the user, highlighting:
- How many total transcripts are available
- The current session ID
- How many HTML reports have been generated
- Whether they're ready to create new reports
