# Patterns & Best Practices

## Commands

```bash
# Analyze tradeoffs between approaches (recommended)
websearch -m reason "tradeoffs between X vs Y for Z"

# Deep research on architecture patterns
websearch -m research "best practices for X architecture"

# Find real-world implementations
websearch -p github "pattern-name implementation language"

# Find community consensus
websearch "recommended approach for X"
```

## Guidelines

- `-m reason` for comparison/tradeoff questions — structured analysis
- `-m research` for comprehensive overviews of a pattern (slow)
- `-p github` to find real implementations demonstrating a pattern
- Frame queries as tradeoff questions: "X vs Y" or "when to use X over Y"
